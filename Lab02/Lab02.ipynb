    "## Overview\n",
    "Last week we introduced the Python function input(), which is used to take in string data. This week we will use input() to take in string and numeric (float and integer) data. \n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that all data returned from input() is a string object, so this will mean that you need to convert any numeric data to their respective numeric objects. The exercises in this lab will give you practice manipulating various types of data that commonly arise in computational biology problems.\n",

    " \n",
    "Let’s say that we have three points in space labeled P, Q and R. We are interested in the angle at point Q that is made from line segments QP and QR.\n",
    "The dot product tells us (for standard vectors P and R) that:\n",
    "$$P \\cdot R=\\|P\\| \\|R\\| \\cos{\\theta}$$\n",

    "$$P \\cdot R = \\sum^{i \\in x,y,z}{P_i R_i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, to find vector P in standard form, we need to remember that QP starts at Q, so we need to place the origin at Q and find out where P is in that new space. We do that by subtracting the components of Q from P.\n",
    "Putting all of this together, we get:\n",
    "$$\\theta=\\cos^{-1}{\\frac{\\sum^{i \\in x,y,z}{(P_i - Q_i) (R_i - Q_i) }} {\\|QP\\| \\|QR\\|}}$$\n",

    "A reasonable solution for this exercise involves around 12 lines of additional code excluding comments.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get full credit on this assignment, your code needs to:\n",
